/*
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7


return its depth = 3.

/*
Complexity analysis

Time complexity : we visit each node exactly once, thus the time complexity is {O}O(N), where N is the number of nodes.

Space complexity : in the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only left child node,
the recursion call would occur N times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be
 {O}(N). But in the best case (the tree is completely balanced), the height of the tree would be log(N). Therefore,
 the space complexity in this case would be O(log(N)).
